# ReactChat

This app is a practice on how to use ReactJS, Auth0, and Pusher to create a chat app.

You can read the tutorial here on Auth0 - https://auth0.com/blog/build-a-chat-app-with-react/
and the demonstration of the chat app here -
https://github.com/yomete/pusher-auth0

## How to run this app

1. Clone the repo - `https://github.com/miavii/react-pusher`
2. Open `src/Auth/auth0-variables.js`, `server.js` and `src/Chat/Chat.js`and edit with your Auth0 and Pusher credentials which can be gotten from the [Pusher dashboard](https://pusher.com)
3. In the root of the project folder, run `yarn` to install all dependencies.
4. Then run `yarn start` to get the app up and running.


**Note: Had changed some things from the original to get it working for me as the guide didn't work perfectly**
